CmdrArduinoMS
===========

CmdrArduinoMS is a fork of Don Goodman-Wilson's [CmdrArduino](https://github.com/Railstars/CmdrArduino) DCC command station library 
designed for use with the [Arduino Motor Shield R3](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoMotorShieldR3).  

Due to the Motor Shield's pinout, this only works with the Mega, as it's the only Arduino with
timer compare outputs on the right pins.

Just like the original, CmdrArduinoMS is GPLv3.
